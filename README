# Why?
Playing with friends is really fun! But each time you have to loot something in a structure there is only one instance of the loot... That's kind of sad right? :c
With Loot4Everyone you will **NEVER** have this problem anymore!
# How?
The mod creates unique instances of the loot for every player in the server, everything is stored inside the map so don't worry about losing anything when changing to another server!
# What type of containers is supported?
For now the mod supports:
- Loot Chests
- Loot Barrels
- Loot Minecart Chests
- Item Frame with Elytra in End Cities
Don't hesitate to suggest other loot containers on Github or Discord!
